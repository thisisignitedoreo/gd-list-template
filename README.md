# How-To
To do your custom lvl list:<br />
1. Fork this repo<br />
2. In `index.html` change 'Example list' to something your own.<br />
3. Change `list.json` to your own list, example already in file.<br />
4. In Github select `list.json`, click _Raw_ and copy link, change link in `index.html` (**line 27**) to copied link<br />
5. Goto repo settings, then goto **Pages**, select main branch, then save. You will see a brand new link, goto it.<br />
6. Ta-da! Your own custom list is DONE!!! Delete README.md, and you are done.<br />
